Hi, Iâ€™m Rayleigh, a third-year statistics Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan. I work with Prof. Long Nguyen on clustering and modeling datasets that have few explanatory variables, but relationships worth discovering. For instance, I have been developing models to transform data on simplexes to model changes in neighborhood income proportions. Another area I am interested in exploring more is Bayesian computation. My research is supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
<br/>

I received my BA in mathematics from the University of Columbia. Before starting my Ph.D., I also had an opportunity to work under Professor Andrew Gelman, contributing to Stan and working on applied Bayesian regression projects.
